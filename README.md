# mobius-visualization

## objective
This project demonstrates the creation and analysis of a Möbius strip using Python. The Möbius strip is a unique surface with only one side and one edge, making it a fascinating object for mathematical exploration.
## Features

1) Customizable Parameters: Adjust radius, width, and resolution of the Möbius strip.
2) Numerical Calculations: Compute surface area and edge length with precision.
3) 3D Visualization: Generate a detailed 3D plot of the Möbius strip.


## Code Overview:

### MobiusStrip Class:

Initialization:
 Accepts radius, width, and resolution as inputs.

 Mesh Generation: 
 Calculates the 3D coordinates of the Möbius strip.

 Surface Area: 
 Uses numerical integration for accurate area approximation.

 Edge Length: 
 Calculates the total length of the Möbius strip’s boundary.

 Visualization: 
 Renders a 3D plot using Matplotlib.

### Main Script:

Demonstrates the usage of the MobiusStrip class.

Calculates and prints surface area and edge length.

Displays a 3D plot.

### How to Use:

## Clone this repository:
  git clone <repository-url>
## Install the required libraries:
  pip install numpy matplotlib
## Run the script:
   python mobius_strip.py

### Outputs

Surface Area: The approximate surface area of the Möbius strip.

Edge Length: The calculated boundary length.

3D Plot: A graphical representation of the Möbius strip.
